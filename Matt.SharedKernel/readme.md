## Get started

Simplify the implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and accelerate your CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) journey when using my nuget package. This offers a versatile collection of interfaces and classes meticulously crafted to streamline DDD practices, leverage the Specification Pattern, and more.

## Key Features:

- **Aggregate Principle**: Enforce the Aggregate principle effortlessly within your domain model to maintain consistency and transactional integrity.

- **Specification Pattern**: Define reusable, composable specifications for querying domain objects with ease.

- **CQRS and Mediator with MediatR**: Seamlessly integrate and implement CQRS patterns along with the Mediator pattern using the MediatR library for clear separation of command and query responsibilities.

- **Result Object Patterns**: Leverage the Result object patterns to handle and convey outcomes and errors consistently across your application layers.

- **Auditing Support**: Implement robust auditing mechanisms for tracking and managing changes within your system using auditing functionalities.

- **Auto Registering DI**: Simplify Dependency Injection (DI) by facilitating auto-registration of dependencies, reducing the manual configuration overhead.

With a suite of utilities tailored for DDD, CQRS, Mediator, Result patterns, Auditing, and DI, our package empowers developers to focus on business logic implementation rather than wrestling with infrastructure complexities.
